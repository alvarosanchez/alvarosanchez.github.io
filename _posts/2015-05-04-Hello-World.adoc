= Hello World
:hp-tags: Personal

So I have decided to start (yet another) blog. I already https://web.archive.org/web/20081014060148/http://weblogs.javahispano.org/page/mariscal/[used to have a blog 12 years ago], but after 3 years blogging, I abandoned it.

However, recently I came across http://hubpress.io/[Hubpress], and my reaction was like _"a blogging system powered by GitHub and AsciiDoctor? Fuck yes! I have to try that"_.

So here I am, again :-). Hello World!
